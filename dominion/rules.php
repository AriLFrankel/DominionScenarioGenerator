    <h5>Incomplete Use of Action Cards:</h5>
    <p>The player may still play an Action card even if they are not able to do everything the Action card tells them to do; but the player must do as much as they can (from top to bottom). If a later instruction is contingent on a now impossible instruction, the player does not carry out this later instruction. Additionally, the player must fully resolve an Action card before playing another one (if they are able to play another Action card)</p>
